upd.ig_picpuller.php

The update function has been added to.

It now checks to see if the 'ig_site_id' column exists in the 'ig_picpuller_credentials' table. If it does not exist, it will create it and then fill in the existing Pic Puller Instagram app as being OWNED by the currently logged in control panel. This assumes that the URL of the current control panel is the owner of the site. (NOTE this in the update docs.)




Next: 

X. When Pic Puller is displaying the current app info, compare it against the current site_id and only show that app.



Other:

X Eliminate "old" folder in themes folder.

Add better instructions on Field Type options screen. What does default instructions mean?

Make an interface for changing the default app's site. ????? this is problematic. How do I let a person update that if they did it wrong?

Have the module tags query the current site and use that as the site id

have an override valud for siteid in case you want to use one site app in another site

Make sure the app delete screen TELLS a user which site's app is being deleted.
